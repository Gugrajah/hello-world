# hello-world
=====================

Hi Humans, 

Gugrajah here. For my junior degree I enrolled for accounting sciences. For now 
I am busy with the fourth and last year of a BA in philosophy. 

I am trying to learn coding, especially using python. Python seems intuitive to me
and that is the reason for choosing to work using it. When I am not wasting my
time on python, I waste it reading a lot on cyber security.

That's me folks. 

Regards.
